# go-server
I'm learning Go and decided to combine it with my web development knowledge.

# use
Clone this repository to the directory of your choice before doing anything else.

Now run the script by doing

```shell
> cd src
> go run main.go
```

If you are on Windows and are bothered by firewall you might want to do this instead

```shell
> cd src
> go build server.exe && server.exe
```

Now to test to see if it works go to `http://localhost/test`, it should say "it works"
